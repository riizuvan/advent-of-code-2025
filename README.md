### Update #1: It's that time of the year again... So let's go!!

### Update #2: Regex backreferences for the win!

### Update #3: 1/3 of this year's (shorter) AOC done! So far nice and fun puzzles as always. Let's see how the rest of the days go!

### Update #4: Went to the countryside for the weekend to make some sausages, so I wasn't solving puzzles on Friday and the weekend. Today I solved days 5–8, which puts me back on track!

### Update #5: Found out today about z3 library which is great in theorem proving and constraint solving and SMT problems.. 2 days left!
